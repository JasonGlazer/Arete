Ar&#234;te - A Collaborative Energy Performance Standard for Buildings
======================================================================

Principals
----------

-	The required level of energy performance to comply with the standard for the particular building being 
designed would be based on the design performance of similar buildings already built using the standard. 
This would be a ratchet mechanism that increased energy efficiency with time.

-	Early during the design process of the building, enough of the building requirements are made public so 
that vendors and other organizations can propose alternative designs (presumably using automated systems) 
so that the building owner gets to consider options that do not cost much more but save additional energy.

- Focus the requirements on inspectable and modelable portions of the building design and for uninspectable 
portions fix the modeling requirements so that no energy benefit can be assumed.

- Include, or reference, content in the standard for everything needed to support the the ecosystem to achieve 
use of and compliance with the standard. 

- Contain options so that various jursidictions or incentive programs can adopt the standard in a way that is 
consistent with their goals but keep many portions common to sustain a single ecosystem.





Requirements for Building Design Team
-------------------------------------
After the building requirements are settled but prior to any detailed design work, a file in the format of the 
Schema for Design Requirements will be provided to one or more Clearinghouse Providers.

The final building design shall meet the Energy Target. 

A building energy model the corresponds with the final design in either native simulation program files or in files 
based on an accepted industry schema shall be provided to one or more ClearingHouse Providers. If many identical or nearly 
identical buildings are based on the same design, a single building energy model shall be provided. Final energy building
models shall clearly identify the type of space for each room or group of adjacent rooms in the building model. The final
building energy model shall be complete enough that the Clearinghouse Providers can run simulations and recreate the 
exact energy predicted to be used by the building. For each type of space in the building, the total energy for each utility 
as well as the area, volume, and the number of occupants, and other indices of usage for the type of space shall be described
in the building energy model and in a file in the format of the Schema for Final Building Energy Model Results.







Computing the Energy Target
---------------------------
The Energy Target for a specific building is based on the population of the buildings designed under the standard in 
recent years. The Energy Target shall be based on the sum of the energy usage for each type of space within the building.


Requirements for Clearinghouse Providers
----------------------------------------
The clearinghouse will accept files in the schema for design requirements for the building from the building 
design team and provide them publicly for measure providers. These public models can either be anonymous or 
identified. 

Building energy models that describe common layouts
for the building will be accepted by the measure providers and provided publicly to other measure providers in 
either native simulation files or industry schemas. 

The clearinghouse will accept final building energy design models 




Requirements for Measure Providers
----------------------------------
Measure providers must agree not to initiate contact with building owners or the building design team and shall
provide their results via clearinghouse providers.




Requirements for Adopters of the Standard
-----------------------------------------



Requirements for Inspectors
---------------------------




Requirements for Building Operators
-----------------------------------


Requirements for Utilities
--------------------------
Monthly energy consumption for a building will be provided to the clearinghouse each year on the anniversary 
of the first day of the first billing cycle.
